# ERC20

This project lets you deploy your own ERC20 Token.

The Manual Token contract is basically the same thing as the ERC20 Standard, but it is missing some functionality.

OurToken.sol is deploying a contract using the ERC20 Standard and it inherits all of the ERC20 functionality!

It is highly recommended not to deploy ManualToken.sol!
